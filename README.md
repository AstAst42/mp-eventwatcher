## Usage:
- cd to MAD/plugins/
- `git clone https://github.com/ccev/mp-eventwatcher.git`
- `cp plugin.ini.example plugin.ini`
- Restart MAD
- The only config option is the sleep time in-between runs. by default, it's 1 hour.

If you want automatic updates for this plugin, you can set up cron to auto-pull for you. I will update this plugin so that it won't destroy anything without manual inputs.
